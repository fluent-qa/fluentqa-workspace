# Portal and Network
The relationship between an existing developer portal possessing API documentation and the Postman API network, workspaces, and collections helps bridge the developer experience across an API providers community and the wider Postman developer community.

- Get Started - Create a dedicated guide like Datadog and Twilio with step-by-step instructions and helpful screenshots on how to get started with their collections in Postman.
- API resources - Some publishers, like EasyPost, catalog their Postman references under API libraries and standards. Some publishers, like Plaid, point to their collection in the README of a repository.
- Multiple collections - If you have lots of APIs, incorporate Postman Collections throughout your API reference, like Twitter and Zoho, for each of your documented APIs.
- Optimize search in Postman - In Postman, optimize your discoverability by including collection descriptions, keywords, and choose an eponymous team domain, like Stripe.
- Optimize search in your docs - In the same way that you optimize for search on Postman, consider the search experience within your own docs and ensure collections, tutorials, and references are indexed properly, like Cisco and Microsoft.
- Run in Postman - Use Run in Postman buttons, like Brex and Okta, so users can directly fork the collection (and optional environment) from within your developer docs. You will know it is a live version of the button instead of the deprecated, static version because clicking through prompts you to “fork” instead of “import” the collection.
- Bundle collection and environment - If you provide a corresponding environment for your collection, bundle them together in the button so users can fork both at the same time, instead of separately.
- Style the button - The bright orange Run in Postman button is recognizable to most developers, but you can also style the appearance to match your documentation’s theme and aesthetics, like Google does in their docs.
- Pre-fill the environment - Save your developers some copying and pasting, and pre-fill the environment with your users’ own credentials via the Run in Postman API if you have access to client-side JavaScript for your documentation. If not, be sure to include a link in your Postman collection to show users where to get an API key.
- Watch - Encourage your users to “watch” the workspace in addition to forking like Belvo does so users are notified about new updates and can pull those updates to their own collection.
