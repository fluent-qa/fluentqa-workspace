# Secure
Properly securing the access and operations surrounding each API, ensuring only those who should have access are able to make requests and publish messages. Establishing an organization-wide approach to how API authentication work, encryption is applied, but also secrets, roles, and APIs are fuzzed and scanned for vulnerabilities. Providing teams with everything they need to secure each API and the operations around them, consistently securing the expanding API landscape.

- **Authentication - Helping ensure APIs are access only by those who should have access, helping API producers apply consistently, and consumer easily apply when integrating.
- **Authorization - Once a user is authenticated it the authorization layer will make sure they only have access to the resources they are approved to,helping navigate resources.
- **RBAC - ole based access control should be applied at the authorization layer of an API, but also to the API operations around them, helping govern who has aces to operations.
- **Encryption - Ensuring that all API requests are encryption, making sure the staging of proper encryption, as well as the reading of encrypted messages is as easy as possible.
- **Environments - Have a solid mapping of the development, staging, and production environments available across all APIs in operation, helping manage essential details.
- **Variables - Providing a well-defined vocabulary of variables that abstract away the common aspects of authentication, authorization, helping standardized the way we engage with APIs.
- **Secrets - Adding a layer on top of environmental variable specifically for manaing secrets, making sure you have clear visibility and control of secrets an tokens being applied.
- **OWASP Top 10  - The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness for API producers, covering a broad consensus about the most critical security risks for web APIs.

There are many layers to security when it comes to producing and consuming APIs, making it a consideration that is increasingly moving earlier on in the API lifecycle, and not after an API goes live.
