# Strengthening Partnerships
As business increasingly gets conducted online via partners, SaaS, and other external services, the urgency to make internal APIs available to partners has increased. The line between inside the firewall and outside the firewall is getting more blurred, making having always available digital resources for external trusted partners to tap into a priority. 

- **Purpose** - Providing a much clearer definition for approach partnerships, offering a clear menu of enterprise resources and capabilities being made available for partners, helping make partnerships more self-services, streamlined, and repeatable across relationships.
- **Onboarding** - Reducing the onboarding of partners from weeks or months down to hours and days, making the process as self-service and automated as possible, reducing friction when it comes to qualifying partners, but then quickly getting them access.
- **Access** - It is common for their to be early and exclusive access to API resources and capabilities, offering preferred access to a specific group, or groups of partners, offering the more valuable and interesting APIs to trusted partners before the general public.
- **Innovation** - Incentivizing innovation amongst partners, leveraging preferred access to fuel the development of new and interesting products and services, leaning on partners to delivering applications, integrationsm plugins, and other interesting business use cases.
- **Exposure** - APIs increase your exposure in partnership scenarios, increasing the chance you will be able to quickie respond to ephemeral situations that exposure your organization to new opportunities by being able to immediately respond and be ready for any situation.
- **Marketing** - The digital resources and capabilities made available via APIs provide what you need for marketing campaigns, and being API-first allows your teams to reach entirely new levels of marketing automation to be able to do more with less, and have a bigger impact.
- **Branding** - There is an opportunity to extend the brand of a company across external communities, and via existing social networks, leveraging APIs to public and aggregate content and media, that can push a brand out via partner platforms.
- **Communications** - Feedback loops are a natural part of modern API operations, and offer an opportunity to gather and use feedback from partners to inform the API roadmap, tapping into a network of trusted partners to help drive business.

Self-service APIs equipped with a well-defined onboarding process, provide a proven way to securely connect businesses together, establishing a digital contact between two companies, which can then be fulfilled via synchronous and asynchronous digital transactions via APIs.
