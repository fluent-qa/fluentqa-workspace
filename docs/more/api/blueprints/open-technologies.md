# Postman Open Technologies

Postman Open Technologies is a program dedicated to educating the world when it comes to everything API, helping companies, organizations, and government agencies optimize their approach to the API lifecycle and how they approach API governance, while also investing in, adopting, and producing the open source specifications, standards, and tooling that are continuing to shape the modern API-first enterprise operation. 

## Engage (Learn)
Within Open Technologies, our first team, dubbed “Engage”, also known as Developer Relations (Devrel), is focused on advocating the impact that APIs are making across the globe, helping educate developers and non-developers about the important role that APIs play in our personal and professional lives, reaching across communities that are being impacted by the API economy to cultivate awareness of a modern approach to producing and consuming APIs.

* Advocacy - Dedicated to telling stories that advocate for the important role that APIs play in our personal and professional lives, writing blog posts, producing videos, and meeting API builders where they are at.
* Education - Providing self-service and in-person learning opportunities when it comes to producing and consuming APIs, helping onboard the masses to the critical role that APIs are playing across all of our applications.
* Community - Engaging within existing developer and non-developer communities, working to better understand how APIs are shifting how technology is being developed and evolved, building relationships along the way.

Engagement with both technical and non-technical business stakeholders across startups and enterprise organizations is an essential part of the Postman platform feedback loop, and engaging with API producers and consumers, understanding more about where they are at in their API journey, and finding ways we can help educate and advocate is what powers the Postman API platform. 

## Platform (Master)
The second team within Open Technologies is dedicated to helping API producers and consumers better master how they are putting APIs to work, providing blueprints for common concepts in play across enterprise and startup API operations, providing reusable processes, integrations and practices that help strength the API lifecycle across an organization while also effectively applying API governance across domains.

* Blueprints - Simple blueprints that outline common concepts that are commonly applied across API operations, then augmenting with blog posts, videos, and other resources that help provide reusable components of a modern API lifecycle.
* Integrations - Showcase and develop native and collection-defined integrations that embrace the reality that API operations is defined by not just a handful of solutions, but many different on-premise and cloud services stitched together.
* Governance - Provider platform governance rules, guidelines, and other resources that help enable developers across steams while bringing alignment when it comes to API discovery, consistency, reliability, and the lifecycle.

The Postman Open Technologies platform teams works internally across Postman, but also externally with customers and the community to help stabilize how we all see the API lifecycle, striking a balance between both API producer and consumer to establish healthier and more well-known API lifecycle, which can be governed centrally across the enterprise, but also effectively federated across many domains, teams, and external business and technical stakeholders.

## Engineer (Build)
The third and final team within Postman Open Technologies is the “Engineer” team who represent a cast of characters assembled from across the most important open-source communities where API specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON are being shaped, API standards like FHIR and PSD2 are forged, and the tooling that put all of these critical specifications and standards to work, helping shape the future of the Postman API platform, but also the API platform of every company, organization, and government agency struggling with their digital transformation.

* Specifications - We have team members dedicated to helping move forward OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL, SOAP, and other specifications that are shaping the modern API toolbox, helping inform all of our journey.
* Standards - The team is regularly staying in tune with industry standards that are shaping not just how we do APIs, but also entire industries, understanding the impact that GDPR, PSD2, FHIR, and other standards are having.
* Tooling - Specifications and standards provide the backbone of any API platform, but it is the tooling that makes everything move forward, and regular investment in open-source tooling is part of what the engineer team delivers.

Our open source specifications, standards, and tooling teams are given the agency to immerse themselves full time into the open communities of their choice, helping contribute code, content, and other value with their respective community, while also informing the Postman API platform road map regarding the capabilities that truly matter, providing the building blocks we all need to ensure our API operations are as standardized and interoperable as they possibly can.
