# Collaborative
Doing business in the cloud means you can collaborate with internal teams, partner stakeholders, and even the public when it comes to producing and consuming APIs. Connecting technical and non-technical stakeholders when it comes to delivering and applying the digital resources and capabilities that are needed to do business. Allowing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people to collaborate when it comes to building and using the digital resources and cpabiities that shape how we do business today, but also tomorrow.

- **Teams** - API-first means teams are well defined within their domain and groups, roles are clear, and discovery and access control is well-defined to enable desired outcomes.
- **Workspaces** - Work on APIs is available vai dedicated workspaces, where stakeholders can find artifacts, documentation, and collaborate with teams to put APIs to work.
- **Watch** - Team members, stakeholders, and when logical, even public consumers can choose to watch an API and the work going on behind it, receiving regular notifications.
- **Forking** - API artifacts, documentation, environments, and other elements should be forkable so that other team members and consumers can fork, use, and help evolve.
- **Pull Requests** - Allowing team members and other consumers to submit pull requests across API operations to contribute potential change that can be merged by teams.
- **Sharing** - Each element of the API lifecycle is shareable, allowing API artifacts, documentation, tests, mock servers, and other elements to be easily shared by teams.
- **Publishing** - Documentation, buttons, and other embeddables can be published to networks, catalogs, directories, portals, or even simple as a blog or social media post.
- **Conversations** - There are active conversation around around each API, and across API operations, ensuring there are feedback loops present for teams, and consumers.


APIs are very technical and abstract, but only flourish when there are active relationships present between API producers and consumers, and at scale across an entire organization, or possibly within a specific industry. Making collaboration the essential nutrient present in the most vibrant enterprise API operations, and the companies we see leading the way in their industries and markets.
