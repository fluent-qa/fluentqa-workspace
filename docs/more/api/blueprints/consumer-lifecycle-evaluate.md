# Evaluate
Once a consumer has discovered an API they will always need time to evaluate whether or not it will meet their needs. An experience that is significantly streamlined when it is a hands-on experience, allowing consumers to play with real functionality, learn about resources and capabilities by doing something rather than just reading. Giving API consumers the information they need to make an educated decision about whether or not an API will satisfy their needs, helping them feel empowered to understand how an API fits into the business solution they are looking to build.

- **Explore** - Enabling consumers with the ability to explore as much of the surface area of an API as possible, possibly without even authenticating, helping learn about what is possible.
- **Execute** - Providing the ability to execute each request, response, publish, and subscribe, making sure that learning about an API is as hands on as it possibly can be for consumers.
- **Examples** - Making sure there are always examples for each element of an API, allowing API contracts to be mocked and provide rich documentation show how it works.
- **Documentation** - Ensure there is always rich documentation with useful descriptions, examples, and other information that helps consumers get started using each API.
- **Workflows** - Go beyond reference documentation and provide actual business workflows that consumers can use to accomplish scenarios they will need in their work.
- **Demonstrate** - Show consumers how it all works, providing tutorials, videos, and other stories that demonstrate what is possible when you put APIs to work in applicaitons.
- **Forking ** - Make your documentation, mock servers, tests, and workflows forkable, enabling consumers to fork artifacts that help them onboard and use an API faster.
- **Feedback** - Make it easy to provide feedback as consumers are evaluating an API, capturing as much feedback from the experience as possible to inform the API roadmap.

Investing in the evaluate stage of a consumer-centric API lifecycle helps reduce consumers time to first call, or more importantly, time to first transaction, making it as easy as possible for consumers to begin generating value in their applications, but also on the API platform.
