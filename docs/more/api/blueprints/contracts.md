# Contracts
On top of the protocols and patterns employed by API producers, a variety of machine and human-readable contracts have emerged to help govern not just the technical, but also the business and even legal aspects of the API producer and consumer relationship. These contracts are being used to make sure producers and consumers are on the same page, providing a single source of truth for each version of an API being made available.

## Specifications
A handful of specifications have emerged that help us describe the surface area of our synchronous and asynchronous APIs, employing a mix or protocols, patterns, styles, and formats. Providing a machine and human readable formats we can use to define the contracts available between producer and consumer.

- **OpenAPI** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **AsyncAPI** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **JSON Schema** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Protocol Buffers** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Collections** -  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **GraphQL** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **WSDL** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.

API contracts provide the technical, but also business details of the relationship between API producer and consumer, moving everyone to a shared understanding of what can be expected with each version of an API, the quality of service, and the digital resources and capabilities being made available.
