The agility associated with high performing API-first approaches to business was demonstrated in how Amazon changed doing business with Amazon Web Services, and with what API-first startups like Stripe and Twilio set into motion by enabling the development of ridesharing, food delivery, and other gig economy businesses. APIs allow startups, but also enterprise organizations to rapidly iterate in a way that possesses a feedback loop with consumers, keeping the trajectory and velocity of APIs to move in the directions that matter, increasing the potential for creating entirely new ways of doing business.

- **Domains** - Well-defined domains within the enterprise don’t just result in more productivity, quality, and a governed API lifecycle, then can transcend their platforms, communities, and create entire new industry-level domains. Allowing enterprise organizations to notjust lead, but set the rules when it comes to how business works.
- **Products** - An API platform factory floor that is capable of delivering the entirely new products that markets want, need, or are completely unaware that they need. Iterating upon, and evolving the products consumers are needing, responding rapidly to changing market demands through rapid iteration on APIs, and the applications they support.
- **Standards** - The design, schema, and approaches adopted across the enterprise become so maturity and useful to business that they begin to be emulated and adopted in other external APIs, becoming the defacto standard within an industry, not through a traditional standards body, but leading by example and delivering what is needed.
- **Velocity** - Achieving levels of enterprise-wide velocity so that other competitors can’t keep pace, or face no chance in being able to catch up. Optimizing the digital factory floor in such a perpetual and nimble way, that large enterprises are able to build up so much momentum, that it starts to set the tone for an entirely new way of doing business.
- **Pulse** - Through an extensive network of feedback loops with consumers across thousands of internal, partner, and public APIs the enterprise is able to maintain a fix on the pulse of what is needed across an industry, or multiple industries, allowing a single business to redefine existing industries or create entirely new ways of doing business.

Being API-first is how Amazon invented the cloud, and it is how Stripe and Twilio helped enable the gig or sharing economy. These were entirely new approaches to doing business that didn’t exist before, establishing entirely new categories of value creation for markets and consumers. Being API-first is how the categories of the next fifty years will be shaped and dominated, leaving only the enterprise organizatons who are able to internalize and transform their API-first state of operation into bringing us the next big thing.
