# World Building
APIs are providing the building blocks of modern digital transformation. Providing the reusable, composable, and scalable units of value that are defining digital resources across every industry. Providing the ability to deploy and operate essential services across multiple clouds and multiple regions, allowing enterprise organizations to redefine and rebuild their business anew in a much more resilient manner. Providing the digital capabilities needed to sustain existing businesses but also define entirely new sectors we haven’t imagined yet.

- **Resources** - The enterprise has the required digital resources at its disposal for assembling the applications, integrations, and automation needed, but it also as the API factory floor with the capacity to deliver the next generation of resources needed. Providing the building blocks any future world we want to build, allowing us to manifest the products we know markets will need.
- **Capabilities** - There are thousands of business workflows in motion across the enterprise aint any given second–providing discoverable, well-defined, and executable by business and technical stakeholders, providing the fuel for business operations today. The operatons that makes this possible allows for the rapid creation, maturing, and scaling of known and unknown workflows the enterprise needs to do business tomorrow.
- **Scale** - Combined with the elasticity of the cloud, an API-first digital platform provides the scale required to build entirely new world, providing a unlimited supply of digital resources and capabilities, as well as the teams to deliver what isn’t currently in inventory. Allowing new products to be rapidly created, iterated upon, and then scaled to meet the demand of markets within days and weeks, and not years, providing the just in time scale that is needed to compete in a digital world.
- **Multi-Cloud** - The next era of cloud computing will not be isolated to a single cloud, and the enterprises who have achieved a world building level of operations are finding success operating across all of the cloud platform. Investing in the talent, processes, and infrastructure needed to wrestle with the nuance of each cloud platform, but leveraging APIs to abstract away the differences, and successfully operate in all of the top cloud providers whenever business demands it.
- **Multi-Region** - API-first enterprises are applying their new found API-first agility and velocity to standing up and operating API infrastructure in regions that are closest to their consumers. Responding to regulation, data nationalism, but also reducing latency by operating closer to the edge of their busines networks. Helping organizations define their operations by domain, but also by geographic region, optimizing their platform experience by leverage APis and the cloud to provide a better consumer experience.
- **Regulated** - An API platform lends itself to a highly regulated enterprise operations, responding to internal as well as external influences in a balanced way. Layering government regulation into a mix of governance that has given leadership more control over how the enterprise responds to markets and regulators, while staying focused on the needs of consumers. Pushing regulation to a state where the enterprise has control to shape whether it is a positive or negative force how how a company does business. 

APIs are the digital building blocks of the online global marketplace. APis are how the last twenty years has be built, and it is how tomorrow digital landscape will be built, providing the building blocks of each new layer of the API economy that will be perpetually changing and iterating upon yesterdays economy.
