The modern enterprise is made up of hundreds or thousands of individual digital resources that are stored in databases and file systems, and put to work across a dizzying array of desktop, web, mobile, and other types of applications or integrations. You see the vast inventory of enterprise digital resources present in the browser URLs, and digital experiences we encounter in our personal and professional lives. Shaping our offline and online experiences each day as we engage at work, at home, and throughout the day on our mobile devices.
