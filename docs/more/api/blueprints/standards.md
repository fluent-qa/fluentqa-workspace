# Standards
Standards help us not reinvent the wheel when it comes to the digital resources and capabilities we are providing, but also help ensure our APIs are as interoperable with other systems as possible. There are a wide variety of more general or very precise API standards to apply as part of API operations, providing us with solutions ranging from the backbone of the Internet level considerations, as well as common healthy patterns for organizations to use when making APIs intuitive and easy to use.

# Internet Standards
APIs are just the next evolution of the web, and there are a number of existing Internet standards that should be applied regularly as part of API operations. 

- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)** - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a standards organization that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers.
- **Request for Comments (RFCs)** - A Request for Comments is a publication in a series, from the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force, authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.

## Industry Standards
Data, and other interoperability and communication standards have existed at the industry level since the birth of compute and the Internet, but more recently are being evolved to support modern approaches to delivering APIs behind web, mobile, device, and other types of applications. 

- **PSD2** - A European Union (EU) Directive, administered by the European Commission to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), providing a common set of industry API standards for financial enterprises, service, and tooling providers to follow when delivering API infrastructure.
- **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** - A standard describing data formats and APIs for exchanging electronic health records (EHR), providing a common set of digital object and API paths for accessing digital healthcare records using modern API infrastructure.
