- **Applications** ~ Work to reuse APIs across the applications you are developing, optimizing the API surface area.
- **Visibility** - Make sure you are following a common plan when it comes to publishing internal and external aPis.
- **Quality** - Make sure there are contract, uptime, and other tests available for 100% of the APIs you are building.
- **Security** - Encourage your centralized security teams to equip you with more tooling for applying API security.
- **Productivity** - Spend time learning about and practice each step of the API lifecycle used by your team.
- **Velocity** - Define every step in the process, and the tooling used to produce and consume APIs on your team.
- **Observability** - Pipe all the results of your contract, performance, security, and other tests into APM solutions.
- **Governance** ~ Communicate with leadership where the friction with producing or consuming APIs exists.
- **Standards** ~ Leverage Internet, industry, and enterprise standards as part of the API design process.
- **Regulations** ~ Ensure your APIs are well documented, and you know where all of your data is avaialble.
