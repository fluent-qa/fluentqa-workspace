# Product Management
API product management is the business and human bridge between API producers and consumers, providing a scaffolding to hang your APIs on that you are treating like products, but also making sure you are approaching the API lifecycle with an empathy for your API consumers, and delivering an experience that speaks to their worlds, while also being in alignment with your overall business goals. Creating and shaping the market for APIs, having a plan for how you are moving forward, and making sure you are measuring and reporting on the right things as  you engage with consumers on this ongoing API journey you are both on.

- **Customers** - Putting the consumer first when it comes to the design and evolution of APIs, prioritizing what they need, and what motivates them using a feedback loop.
- **Empathy** - Put a heavy focus on developing empathy with your consumers, exploring ways you can put yourself in their shoes, and develop a road map that speaks to this.
- **Experience** - Make sure each API you produce delivers an experience for consumers, and the overall experience onboarding, using, and providing feedback is always smooth.
- **Storytelling** - Develop stories to express what each API does by encouraging teams to write a narrative for each API, helping producers think through the story they wish to tell.
- **Marketing** - Have a go-to-market (GTM) strategy for each API, and a scaffolding to help teams think through and execute against their GTM strategy with each version release.
- **Road Map** - Publish a road map for each API, include other stakeholders, and consumers in the planning of this road map, then keep up to date and in sync with APIs.
- **Analytics** - Measure as much of the activity around the usage of your API, but also the operations around your API, providing the data you need to understand consumption.
- **Feedback Loop** - Make it easy for your consumers to provide feedback, aggregate and organize it for use as part of your road map planning, and iteration of your APIs.

Moving APIs from being just implementation feature for your digital products, to APIs being the digital product will help produce the productivity and quality you are looking for, while delivering digital products that consumers want.
