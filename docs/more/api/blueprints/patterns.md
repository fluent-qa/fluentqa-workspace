# Patterns
There are many common patterns in use across the API sector, but the foundation of the modern API toolbox continues to be REST. with GraphQL, Websockets, and increasingly gRPC. The line between pattern and protocol is often a blurry one, but there are a handful of well-known patterns that act as the cornerstone for API applications and integrations, depending on which industry or layer of the enterprise an API is operating in.

- **REST** - Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed system should behave.
- **GraphQL** -  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
- **Websockets** - WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and is used heavily for financial APIs.
- **gRPC** - gRPC also known as Google Remote Procedure Call is an open source remote procedure call system initially developed at Google in 2015 as the next generation of the RPC infrastructure, but then has become a desired patent used with HTTP/2 internally.
- **Microservices** - A microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Some of these merely provide a style to follow, where others are standardized formats and protocols, but provide a set of agreed upon constraints that can be applied using a specific, or mix of transport protocols to consumers, brokers, and other stakeholders.
