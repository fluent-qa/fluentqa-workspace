# Visibility
APIs are abstract and difficult to see, leaving a lot of anxiety when it comes to who has access and is able to see and put digital resources and capabilities to use. While a significant amount of the discussion around APIs over the last decade has been about public APIs, the majority of APIs that exist are only available privately, or exist in the shadows behind desktop, web, and mobile applications. Leaving enterprise organizations who are further along in their API journey with a significant amount of confidence when it comes to understanding and having control over not just access to APIs, but also the operations that surround them.

## Access
Having the ability to effectively control the visibility of your APIs, being able to quickly and confidently move an API from private or team, to being available to partners or publicly to 3rd party developers will play an outsized role in the overall velocity of an enterprise organization doing business today.

- **Private** - Keeping APIs and the operations around them private and available to an invite only state, keeping artifacts and documentation in the hands of a select audience.
- **Team** - Limiting the access to APIs, workspaces, documentation, and the other elements of the API lifecycle to only the team who will be producing or consuming an API internally.
- **Partner** - Expose APIs, documentation, mock servers, environments, and testing to partners, allowing them to view or even contribute to producing or consuming APIs.
- **Public** - Making workspaces, APIs, and other elements available to the public, allowing anyone to watch, fork, and learn from APIs, as well as the operations and work around them.


## Operations
Visibility of API operations begins with a portal, and has been also rapidly expanding via Git repositories and API workspaces, revealing more than just API documentation and pulling back more of the operational curtain around mock servers, environments, testing, and the monitoring and observability of operations. 

- **Portal** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Workspaces** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod** - **tempor.
- **Repos** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **APIs** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Docs** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Tests** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Mocks** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Environments** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
- **Monitors** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.

The visibility of your APIs and your API operations will be defined by the overall quality and security of your APIs and the API lifecycle. With more experience comes greater confidence, and API teams who have been through more iterations, and are working across a shared API lifecycle, will find they struggle less when it comes to navigating the visibility of the enterprise API landscape.
