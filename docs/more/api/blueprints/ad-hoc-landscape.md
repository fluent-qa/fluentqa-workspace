# An Ad Hoc Landscape
In the fast-paced business environment that exists within almost every enterprise organization, there is a never-ending attraction towards defining digital resources and capabilities in a one-off fashion to support specific projects, applications, and integrations. Leaving a legacy trail of APIs that are often redundant and overlapping, but all in need of equal investment to support and keep reliable and delivering value for the business.

## Common Distractions
There are plenty of distractions when it comes to enterprise operations, but there a common set of ways in which organizations lose their way when it comes to delivering, sustaining, and evolving their API landscape.

-  **One Project** - It is easy to see APIs as just a subset of a project with clear start and completion dates, rather than seeing those APis as part of a larger enterprise system and something that should be discoverable and usable beyond just the project.
-  **One Application** - The needs of a specific web or mobile application are often proritized over seeing the APIs behind them as part of a larger enterprise system, resulting in often redundant APIs or shadow APIs that are not seen because they are obfuscated by apps.
-  **One Partner** - It is common to feel the need to respon to partner requests individual rather than seeing then as part of a larger system, resulting in repetitive work occurring, which when defined as a standardized set of partner resources would help speed up interactions.
-  **One Integration** - Integrations between two internal or external systems provides another common way in which similar business needs end up with one-off solutions that contributes to an ad hoc landscape rather than a ready to go integration toolbox for all business needs.
-  **One Customer** - Some customers are louder than others and may enjoy an outsized role in road map decisions, resulting in APIs that do not serve the wider needs of a customer base, resulting in more overhead when it comes to supporting an ad hoc API business landscape.

In the moment each potential distraction might seem like a priority, however with the gravity of a centralized API strategy and a well-known API lifecycle and governance strategy, they can collectively be harnessed as part of the wider enterprise motion, resulting in less distractions along the way.
