# Jobs to be Done

Jobs Theory provides a framework for categorizing, defining, capturing and organizing the inputs that are required to make innovation predictable, providing a useful framework to think about when designing, delivering, operating, and deprecating APis. Complementing an agile approach to delivering APIs, considering the Jobs to Be Done framework helps define the needs of consumers in the shortest possible timeframe, iterate and respond quicker than the competition.

- **Get Something Done - People buy a product or a service to get something done, they don’t care what a companies incentives are, they just want to accomplish their job.
- **Jobs are Functional - APIs must have a purpose that speaks to the needs of consumers, making an emotional connection, and remain focused on their relationships.
- **Reaching Maturity - A Job-to-be-Done is stable over time, and APIs should reach a level of maturity after enough iterations, stabilizing into a reliable product for consumers.
- **Agnostic Interfaces - A Job-to-be-Done is solution agnostic, and APIs don’t know or care about other APis, it just does one thing, and does it well, focused on job at hand.
- **Measuring Right Thing - Success comes from making a job the unit of analysis, rather than the product or the consumer, focusing on the value being deliver by the API.
- **Marketing Has Impact - A deep understanding of the customer’s job makes marketing more effective — and innovation far more predictable when iterating upon your APis.
- **Get It Done on the Cheap - People want products and services that will help them get a job done better and/or more cheaply, opening up a perpetual opportunity for APIs.
- **Bring Value to Consumers - People seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform, making API integrations what they need.
- **Delivering Success to Consumers - Innovation becomes predictable when “needs” are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting a job done.

A focus on the Jobs to be Done is about an unrelenting focus on the value being delivered by an API, providing what consumers are needing, then relying on your feedback loop to help guide the rapid iteration of your API products, while ensuring you are able to keep everything in alignment with consumers. Providing the fuel for your API to move forward, and the prioritization to help move your enterprise forward using APis.
