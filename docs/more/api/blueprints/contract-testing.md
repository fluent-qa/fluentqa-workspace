# Contract Testing
Contract testing takes the machine-readable contract for an API and then tests each instance of that contract, ensuring the requests and responses, messages, and other details match the contract defined. Providing an executable set of tests that will validate the contract for each API manually as part of producing or consuming the API, enforced as part of the CI/CD pipeline, or scheduled to run from different regions via the monitor.
