# Integrations
Our business digital landscape is increasingly made up of many interconnected systems internally and externally available to our operations, and modern web APIs are increasingly how interoperability between our systems is defined, automated, and evolved.

## Types of Integrations
APIs are powering are being used to connect all parts of enterprise operations, leveraging internal and external APIs to stitch together the expanding digital landscape required to do business today. APis are essential to the interoperability of a distributed enterprise, but also theindustries they operate across.

- **SaaS** - APIs are how the growing number of software as a service, or SaaS solutions we depend on to run our business are made seamless with existing enterprise operations, allowing aspects of business to be outsourced while still maintaining control over usage..
- **Infrastructure** - The infrastructure already in use across enterprise operations likely already possess APIs, providing a huge opportunity for more automation and orchestration across the software already in place within an organization, representing low hanging fruit.
- **Interoperability** - APIs are how distributed and federated parts of enterprise operations are made more interoperable, and how acquisitions, partners, and industry level ingteroperability is set into motion, reducing the challenges involved with working across business divides.
- **Syncing** - The syncing of data across operations and with external partners and services is a regular part of business operations, and APIs are how this is done as efficiently and cost effective as possible, allowing for more alignment across business domains.
- **Migrations** - APIs are how data and objects are migrated between servers, clouds, partners, and other constructs of our regular operations, ensuring small or large amounts of data is made accessible so that it can be migrated to a new location more optimal usage.
- **Automation** - The only way businesses can remain competitive in this digital landscape is through the automation of common business process, and APIs are how those process and the digital resources they depend on are defined, providing what we need to automate it all.
- **Orchestration** - APIs provide the knobs and levers that can be scheduled, triggered, and pulled, responding to common events and setting in motion the processes we need to keep business moving forward, producing just the right performance we desire for our operations.

The average enterprise landscape has thousands of connected servers and platforms they need to do business across, and APIs are how that reality if made whole, or left operating in business isolation.
