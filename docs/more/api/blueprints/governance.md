# Governance
A blueprint for approaching the governance of APIs from the top-down, establishing a higher-level strategy for defining what governance is and then helping spread guidance across teams that helps enable them to deliver more consistent APIs across a more consistent API lifecycle no matter what type of API they are delivering.

- **Organization** - Bolting governance onto the existing organizational apparatus in place for the enterprise, ensuring that API operations is always in alignment with business.
- **Guidelines** - Formal documentation, wiki, or other document that defines what governance is, and how teams are enabled to do the right thing as part of their work.
- **Maturity** - [Need Content]
- **Standards** - Having a strong and ever-evolving awareness of what standards exist inside and outside the enterprise, and a strategy for how standards will be applied.
- **Templates** - Providing as many ready-to-go and reusable templates that help demonstrate and apply patterns, standards, and other elements to APIs and operations.
- **Rules** - Establiishing sets of linting rules that can be applied at design time to guide the creation of standardized APIs, but also applied across the entire API  lifecycle.
- **Policies** - Define standard source control, CI/CD, gateway, and other policies to help govern API operations, standardizing the configuration and velocity of API production.
- **Centralization** - Considering which parts of governance should be centralized, developing a single body within the enterprise who can help guide governance efforts.
- **Federation** - Considering which parts of governance should be federated, relying on teams to help define, shape, and lead when it comes to enablement across operations.
- **Design Reviews** - Formal reviews that look at the design of APIs, providing self-service, but also peer reviews that help API producers consider the big picture when designing.
- **Quality Reviews** - Formal reviews that look at the documentation and testing for each API, helping ensure that all APIs are fully documented and are properly tested.
- **Security Reviews** - Formal reviews that look at the security of each API, ensuring there is encryption, authentication, authorization, and are free from common vulnerabilities.

It is important to remember that capital “G” governance is only a concept that lives higher up within the enterprise, and on the ground floor it is more lowercase “g” governance, or simply enablement, and helping API teams to the right thing without having to think twice or work hard–governance is about the standards, process, and tooling leadership provides to teams.
