# Asynchronous
Enabling more real-time or asynchronous interactions, the web and other network technologies have been adapted to publish and subscribe to large volumes of digital resources and capabilities via highly reliable connections. Using APIs to establish an always-connected set of channels or topics that publish and push digital messages where they need to be to support business functions.

## Publish 

- **Protocols** - Selecting from HTTP, HTTP/2, TCP, MQTT, or some other common protocol that is used for application to asynchronously publish data to internal systems for wider usage.
- **Channel** - Publishing messages to a specific topic or sometimes called a channel, providing a context for each message being published as part of the application using each API.
- **Message** - The JSON or XML message being published, submitting information to a system asynchronously, making it available for consumption by other system via asynchronous API.
- **Schema** - The structure of the message, standardizing how data is being published to the asynchronous API, ensuring that there is a standardized schema available to validate.

## Subscribe

- **Protocols** - Selecting from HTTP, HTTP/2, TCP, MQTT, or some other common protocol that is used for application to asynchronously subscribe to data that is published and available.
- **Channel** - Subscribing to messages published a specific topic or sometimes called a channel, providing a context for each message being subscribed to by each application.
- **Message** - The JSON or XML message being received, providing information from a system asynchronously, making it available for consumption by an application.
- **Schema** - The structure of the message, standardizing how data is being subscribed to the asynchronous API, ensuring that there is a standardized schema available to validate.
