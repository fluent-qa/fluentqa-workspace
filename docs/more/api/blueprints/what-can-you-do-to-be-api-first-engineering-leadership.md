# What Can You Do to Be API-First? (Engineering leadership)
These are a few suggestions for what engineering leadership can consider when it comes to becoming API-first?

- **Strategy** - Document how you operate your team, see the API lifecycle, and share with other teams.
- **Discovery** - Encourage teams to publish API artifacts to source control and syncing via API workspaces.
- **Applications** - Prioritize the design, delivery, and operation of APIs over their individual applications.
- **Visibility** - Establish a strategy for delivering APIs internal and external, and how you can move between.
- **Quality** - Make contract and uptime testing the default across every API being produced across teams.
- **Security** - Shifting security left in the API lifecycle, equipping developers with the security tests they need.
- **Productivity** - Define, optimize, and automate the API lifecycle across teams leveraging existing tooling.
- **Velocity** - Define every step in the process, and the tooling used to produce and consume APIs on your team.
- **Observability** - Pipe all the results of your contract, performance, security, and other tests into APM solutions.
- **Governance** - Help define what the guardrails are for teams when it comes to designing and delivering APIs.
- **Standards** - Leverage Internet, industry, and enterprise standards as part of the API design process.
- **Regulations** - Ensure your APIs are well documented, and the infrastructure behind your APIs also have APIs.
- **Innovations** - Give your team the space to innovate when it comes to how they produce or consume APIs.
