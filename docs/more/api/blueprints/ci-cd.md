# CI/CD
Tapping into the continuous integration and continuous deployment, or better known as CI/CD to help build, test, and automate integrations with internal and external APIs, but also deploy APIs that can be used for applications and integrations. Leveraging the native pipelines of source control or adding on a commercial or open source CI/CD solution, then seamlessly tying how APIs are produced and consumed with the repeatability that is available to us via modern CI/CD solutions.

- **Pipelines** - Utilize CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the API lifecycle is always repeatable, and something that always builds the highest quality API as possible.
- **Variables** - Tapping into a lifecycle-wide strategy for defining variables that get applied as part of the pipeline build process, ensuring that the naming, use, and evolution of variables occurs at a  strategic level. 
- **Collections** - Running contract, performance, security, and other types of collections as part of the pipeline using open source Newman, standardizing and validating as APIs are being built.
- **Environments** - Leveraging standardized guidance for teams to have development, staging, and production environments available for running as part of CI/CD pipelines alongside collections. 
- **Observability** - Tapping into the existing outputs that exist for our CI/CD pipelines and piping data into our API platforms, APM, and other observability and reporting systems.

A modern API lifecycle is built on top of our existing enterprise investment in continuous integration and continuous deployment infrastructure and processes, layering in the usage of common artifacts like OpenAPI, collections, and environments to ensure quality while maintaining velocity across operations.
