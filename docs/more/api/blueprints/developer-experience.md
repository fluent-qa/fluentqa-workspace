# Consumer Experience

The experience that API consumers face when putting APIs to work will forever define and shape the relationship between API producer and consumer. Onboarding is the first impression producers have to make on consumers, and every interaction from there forward is an opportunity to build or lose trust along the way. Establishing a lifelong relationship with consumers who bake your APIs into their applications and integrations, a relationship where there can be mutual value exchanged, if just the right experience exists 

- **Discoverable** - It is easy for consumers to find what they need, with APIs distributed whey consumers frequent, and part of the stories and information they consume on a regular basis, making it effortles to find and understand how an AP will benefit them.
- **Easy Onboarding** - Consumers should be able to from discovery to making their first request in as little as time possible, with as view steps as possible, helping consumer reach the point where value is evident, and the overall experience has been a joy. 
- **Simple** - Keeping APis, documentation, and other supporting elements as simple and intuitive as possible, helping reduce the cogniftive load when it comes to understanding what is possible with an API, keeping the work consumers have to do to a minimum.
- **Consistent** - Every API used has a consistent feel, and employs common patterns, making API integration a familiar experience for consumers, keeping API resources and capabilities as aligned with a consumers view of the world and experience at work.
- **Reliable** - Every step of the onboarding and integration experience, as well as the ongoing support and service after integration should be as reliable, predictable, and dependable as possible, leaving the right impression on consumers in their journey.
- **Documented** - Everything along the way for consumers is documented and explained, ensuring that everything is up-to-date and provides a complete picture for consumers, keeping things short, sweet, and to the point, helping consumers find what they need.
- **Conversation** - Making the relationship between API producer and consumer a conversational one, making sure consumers feel confident in providing feedback, and trusting that they will be heard, helping provide the support consumer need regularly.
- **Supported** - When challenges are faced by consumers, API producers are there to support, helping solve problems and empathizing with consumers regarding the pain they are experiencing, and working to recover and get things back to normal quickly.

Treating yoru APis as products is the best way to help improve the consumer experience, establishing the feedback loops required to understand what consumers are experiencing in near real-time, then working to iterate as fast as possible to respond to consumers, while keeping them in alignment with each release. Measuring everything along the way, relying on your relationship with consumers and the data you gather from across operations to iterate in just the right ways regarding road map for APis.
