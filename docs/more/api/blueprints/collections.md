# Collections
Postman collections are a machine-readable specification for saving API requests in a portable, executable, and documented way, allowing one or many API requests to be organized by folder, then shared or published for use by others. Providing an executable unit of value as defined by each APIs source of truth, but available in a format that can be used to document, mock, test, secure, and automate with APIs.

- **Folders** - Each collection has the ability to define one or many folders and organize API requests into each folder, making collections more intuitive and easier to use.
- **Authentication** - Collections allow the authentication to be defined for any API being consumed, providing most of the top authentication formats used to secure APIs.
- **Documentation** - You can document your APIs, as well as the tests, automation, visualizations, and other use cases for collections, ensuring API operations is documented.
- **Parameters** - The parameters and default values can be provided for each API request, helping define query and path parameters that shape each API request and response.
- **Headers** - Collections allow for HTTP headers to be passed along with each request, shaping the transport of each API request and response being made with collection.
- **Body** - Enabling the ability to add JSON, XML, Text, and other types of data payloads as a body of the request, securely sending (when encrypted) data as part of a request.
- **Responses** - The details of a response, including the HTTP status codes, headers, network information, response time, and the other technical details of the API response for APIs.
- **Scripts** - Collections allow for folder level, as well as pre-request and post-request scripts to be applied, providing scripts that get executed when collections are executed manually.

OpenAPI and AsyncAPI provide a source of truth for each APII, and a collection provides a derivative of that truth for a specific stop along the API lifecycle, providing a versatile way of defining each stop.
