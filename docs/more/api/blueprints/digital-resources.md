# Digital Resources
The modern enterprise is made up of hundreds or thousands of individual digital resources that are stored in databases and file systems, and put to work across a dizzying array of desktop, web, mobile, and other types of applications or integrations. You see the vast inventory of enterprise digital resources present in the browser URLs, and digital experiences we encounter in our personal and professional lives. Shaping our offline and online experiences each day as we engage at work, at home, and throughout the day on our mobile devices.

## Common Digital Objects
APIs are how you define and make digital resources available available online for almost any use case.

- **Users** - Every one of our user profiles are are made accessible via APIs, so that we can login, follow, be followed, allowing thousands or millions of users to engage via a single platform, but more importantly via any platform or device that we choose to engage on.
- **Messages** - We send messages back and forth via APIs, leverage SMS and other common messaging formats, but also the proprietary platfor messaging APIs that allow us to engage with our closest friends, family, and coworkers as we engage in real-time each day.
- **Images** - Every one of those social media images, and photos on our mobile phone is being published, stored, backed up, and shared using APIs, providing us access to visual represenationis of the world around us, but organized and made available digitally online.
- **Videos** - Like images, videos are defined, published, and shared across the web and social meda channels using APIs, allowing us to capture the world around us and then weave these moments into our digital presence, helping us blur the line between on and offline.
- **Payments** - APIs provide us with the ability to send and receive money in small and large amounts to whoever we want around the world, providing us with the basic financial ingredient that makes our world go around, funding the lives we lead on and offline.
- **Documents** - The web is made up of digital documents, HTML, PDF, and other digital files that allow us to do business around the globe, leveraging APIs to publish and share them, but also sign and send them between two parties, making our business more interactive.

These are just some of the most common digital resources we all encounter each day, but there are millions of other digital resources available across the digital landscape we engage with each day.
