# Legacy
APIs are widely being used to address challenges with legacy infrastructure, and teams are finding success using more modular approaches to refactoring order systems to work with modern applications and integrations, and in some cases doing away with legacy infrastructure all together. Helping enterprise organizations deal with technical debt, but then also future proof operations against future tech debt by ensuring that systems are smaller, more modular, and able to be evolved and deprecated without the overhead associated with systems developed in the past.

- **Monolith** - Teams are using APIs to decouple and redefine monolithic legacy systems, reverse engineering and implementing as microservices and APIs to modernize systems.
- **Microservices** - Modular, single-use, synchronous and asynchronous microservices are being used to redefine legacy systems as more distributed and easier to evolve and reuse.
- **Facades** - APIs are used to create facades that can be used to provide modern interfaces for applications, while working to evolve and deprecate legacy backends.
- **Gateways** - Gateways provide a industrial-grade approach to standing up a modernized stack in front of legacy systems without exposing backends infrastructure being modernized.
- **Proxies** - Proxies provide the ability to intercept and map out the traffic in legacy applications, which can be applied to defining and delivering facades and microservices.

APIs are essential modernizing our legacy infrastructure, providing interfaces that can be used in applications, while abstracting away legacy solutions while they are being modernized, without disrupting applications and integrations that are dependent on the digital resources and capabilities delivered by legacy systems.
