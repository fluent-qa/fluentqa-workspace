# APIs as a Product
Treating APIs as a product means doing the hard work to establish user empathy and ensure your APIs are easy to use and possess the shortest time to value. Providing a complete API experience with quality documentation and well-used feedback loops and support channels where you are able to effectively gather and measure the insights needed to iterate upon each version of API, ensuring that each release meets the needs of the widest possible audience you can.

- **Consumer-Centered** - Making sure that the design, development, and operation of your APis is as consumer centered as possible, ensuring your APIs are serving their needs.
- **Experience** - Your API operations focuses on creating the most meaningful experience possible for your consumers, and transcends the resources and capabilities being offered.

- **Measurement- Define your metrics, gather the data, and use it to make sense of how yoru consumers are putting your APIs to work, and how they are made part of the API lifecycle.

Treating your APIs as a product is how you go from technically good APIs to products that meet the needs of consumer, blending both the technology and business of APIs to find the right blaance between API producer and consumerâ€“doing the dance with each version of an API, while keeping producer and consumer in sync as a unit.
