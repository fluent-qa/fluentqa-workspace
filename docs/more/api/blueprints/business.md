APIs are no longer just an IT-led initiative behind applications and support projects. APIs are central to how a business operates and provides the digital capabilities and resources to do business in a digital age. Expanding participation by business stakeholders across the API lifecycle is essential moving from API-early to API-first, and defining the success of your digital transformation.

- **Delivering Products** - Treating your APIs as a product has proven to be the winning strategy for companies over the last decade, ranging from Twilio for messaging, and Stripe for payments. Elevating APIs from being just a checkbox on a digital product, to being its own product, finding more alignment with business, and the consumer.
- **Jobs to Be Done** - Jobs Theory provides a rich way to look at the delivery of APIs as a product, and a framework to set the tone for the feedback loop between producer and consumer. Helping speed up the gathering and prioritization of feedback, data, and other needs surrounding an existing API, then translating that into the next version of the API within days, not weeks or months.
- **Roles** - [Need Content]
- **Consumer Experience** - Making the improvement of discovery, learning, onboarding, support, and other dimensions of the relationship between API producer and consumer a priority. Spending more resources to plan, implement, measure, and iterate upon different approaches to improvig the experience for consumers, reducing friction, and making the lifes of consumers easier by helping them succeed faster.
- **Low Code / No Code** - Investing in low-code/no-code options for producing and consuming APIs, abstracting away the complexity involved with working with digital resources and capabilities. Providing ways of expressing business intent using APIs, then going from intent to integration and business value without having to understand a programming language and how APIs work. 
- **Innovation** - Ensuring there is always time for innovation and experimentation when it comes to producing and consuming APIs, encouraging team members and consumers to explore new ways of putting APIs to work, and abstracting away working with them at scale. Putting a priority on the potential that exists when you operate in an API-first way, and new and experimental digital resources and capabilities might be the competitive edge a company needs when it comes to reaching the right market.

The divide between business and IT needs to become a relic of the past. Todayâ€™s digital factory floor requires all hands on deck, helping find the optimal balance needed to deliver the composable digital products tomorrows consumers are going to need or want.
