# Performance Testing
Performance testing checks the availability and response time of each individual API, often selecting specific paths of an API, and testing how long it takes to make a request and receive a response, or publish and subscribe to messages. Considering the responsiveness of the API, but also potentially the network in between consumers and the API, gateway, and other influencing aspects of how APIs operate. Helping understand over time how performant each API is, keeping a record of the uptime and availability, but also making sure the API meets the expected SLA from the regions that matter most to consumers.
