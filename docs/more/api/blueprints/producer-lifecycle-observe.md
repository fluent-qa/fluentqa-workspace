# Observe
Ensuring that there is observability via existing outputs for the API lifecycle, scheduling the results of monitors to be centrally stored, piped into existing APM solutions, and take advantage of the platform to understand what is happening. Providing teams with the ability to “see” APIs and the operations around them using a set of common metrics, helping provide the data needed to operate and move forward each API independently of others.

- **Activity** - Using the activity across an API platform to understand how APIs are being moved forward, configured, and evolved over time by tapping infrastructure outputs.
- **Logs** - Actively using the logs for source control, CI/CD, and the gateway to provide the outputs needed to understand the velocity of individual APIs, and across domains.
- **Traces** - Leveraging traces added to clients, SDKs, gateways, and other ways to makes sense of API landscape, and how APIs are putting backend infrastructure to work.
- **Monitors** - Establishing monitors for all contract, performance, security, and governance tests, providing the results needed to understand the state of APIs and all of operations.
- **APM** - Routing all outputs from across API operations into APM solutions, tapping every output across the API lifecycle to be able to understand the health and state of the platform.
- **Reports** - Providing team, API, documentation, testing, and other reporting, showing what teams are doing across API operations, and how the lifecycle is unfolding across teams.

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs, tapping into all of the existing outputs available across the API platform and the infrastructure used to move APIs forward across the API lifecycle into production.
