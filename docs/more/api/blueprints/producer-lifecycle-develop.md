# Develop
Getting to work bringing an API to life. Assembling all the infrastructure that is needed, generating any skeletons, using frameworks, and assembling and begin hardening an APIs functionality. The development might take a design-first approach or it might rely on a code-first approach, whicher approach is taken, as long as it follows a common lifecycle, it can be seen as benefiting operations.

- **Compute** - Establishing a baseline for what the underlying compute will be for an API, choosing from virtual servers, containers, and serverless to actually power each API.
- **Database** - Providing the data storage and querying needs for an API, leveraging a centralized database, or establishing a database just for use by this single API resource.
- **Storage** - Defining what the centralized storage will be for an API, having a plan for where objects, images, and other files will be stored, retrieved, and managed as part of API usage.
- **DNS** - Applying a consistent approach to using DNS for each API, following a larger domain strategy, but allowing for flexibility and redundancy when it comes to accessing each API.
- **Encryption** - Ensuring that encryption is the default in transport and storage, and each individual API has this aspect of security applied from the beginning, not as an afterthought. 
- **Frameworks** - Leveraging open source frameworks as the scaffolding for your API, leveraging consistent approaches, and not doing much of the redundant work necessary.
- **Skeletons** - Generating code stubs or skeletons using the contract for an API, leveraging automation to much of the repetitive work of developing an API, help be more efficient.
- **Annotations** - Utilizing code annotations to auto-generate the contracts necessary to document, test, secure, and govern API, leaning on a more code-frist approach to APIs.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - Maximizing productivity across teams by providing further enablement via their trusted IDE, helping increase developer productivity.
- **Source Control** - Establishing a Git repository for managing all of the code and the artifacts for an API, helping establish source control for each API early on in the API lifecycle.
