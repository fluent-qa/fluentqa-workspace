# Define
APIs are a very abstract digital concept, loosely wrapping a variety of text, documentation, artifacts, and code that define what an API is capable of doing. A thoughtful API lifecycle begins with sitting down with all stakeholders and finding a common way of defining each API, but also how it will be moved forward over time. 

- **Goals** - What are the goals for the API, defining the business value that the API will bring, helping provide a list that can help guide development and operation of each API.
- **Stakeholders** - Identifying who the business and technical stakeholders are, and who might need to be involved from external partners, and consumers, helping complete the picture.
- **Domain** - What domain will an API be operating within, defining the vocabulary, standards, and other patterns that are made available at design and development time for developers.
- **Regions** - Identifying which region(s) an API will operate in, helping comply with regulation and other business requirements, ensuring that APIs are as close to consumers as possible.
- **Teams** - Lining up who will be working on an API, bringing together designers, developers, technical writers, QA, and other roles who will be involved in moving APIs forward.
- **Roles** - Defining who on the team will have access to what, defining the roles access to editing, viewing, and working with APIs, and the operations that are moving them forward.
- **Workspaces** - Creating and setting up the workspaces where teams will be designing, developing, and managing APIs, iterating upon them and managing multiple versions.
- **Change** - Establish the underlying approach for managing change with an API, keeping the versioning, communication, and other elements in alignment with centralized governance.
- **Road Map** - Creating a road map for an API, beginning on day one with the planning for what the future holds for an API, ensuring there is always a plan guiding what is next.

A well executed define stage of the API lifecycle helps take a moment to lay the important groundwork that will help contribute to the overall usability of an API, providing the nutrients needed to operate.
