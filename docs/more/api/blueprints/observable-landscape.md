An API-first landscape can be turned into an observable landscape. Taking every output available across all APIs, and the infrastructure behind them, as well as the governance overlaid on top of, and make sure it is considered as part of the overall feedback loop within each domain.  Leveraging collections defined to test each instance of an APIs, the surface area of an API, and the infrastructure used to deliver an an API as the universal observability connector to allow us to see across API operations.
