# Discover
The regular practice of an API consumer being able to find exactly the API that they need for their application or integration. Enabling API consumers to be able to search, browse, and discover the API they need, but also everything they will need to onboard with an API, be able to assess the overall quality and reliability of the API, and get to work quickly integrating it into their use case, no matter what language or platform they are working with.

- **Search** - Consumers should be able to search for APIs using the interaces they are already using, allowing for discovery of API information in manner that is more relevant to their work.
- **APIs** - The contracts and other artifacts that define the surface area of an API, including authentircation and authorization, should be discoverable as part of regular operations.
- **Documentation** - Up-to-date and accurate API documentation for all APIs should be easily discoverable by team, providing human readable details of what is possible with each API.
- **Tests** - The contract, performance, integration, and even user acceptance tests should be made searchable by consumers, helping make not just APIs discoverable, but their tests.
- **Workspaces** - Alongside Git repositories, private, partner, and public workspaces can be included as part of discovery, indexing the places where all work is occurring for each API.
- **Teams** - The teams behind APIs, and the partner or public contributors should be made discoverable alongside documentation and other data, encouraging human engagement.
- **Workflows** - Common workflows using APIs should be made discoverable, helping business and technical stakeholders implement business workflows they need in their work.
- **Changes** - Multiple versions of each API should be made discoverable, indexes each API release and the communications around them, helping consumers easily get up to speed.

Every moment spent looking for an API, trying to find the latest version, and understanding what is possible contributes or removes from the overall motion of a team, domain, and organization, leaving consumer discovery a priority aspect of the API lifecycle to invest in.
