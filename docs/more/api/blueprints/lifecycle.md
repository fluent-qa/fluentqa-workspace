# Lifecycle
A well-known, common, and repeatable API lifecycle is essential to achieving success across API operations. Teams should be given the agency to leverage the tools that help them be successful, but a shared understanding of what the API lifecycle is will be required to achieve the desired productivity and velocity, while being also able to deliver APIs the possess high levels of quality. Providing a proven lifecycle for producers and consumers to engage when it comes to delivering and evolving APIs in a way that strikes the balance needed for forward motion. 

- **Existing** - Map out the API lifecycle as it exists today, documenting how people perceive the lifecycle they employ to produce and consume APIs. Document the differences, as well as the common aspects of how APIs are brought to life but also put to work.
- **Tooling** - Document what tools are in use by teams today, mapping ouit the commercial and open source solutions teams have adopted to help accomplish their work, assembling a toolbox that is required to move your operations forward right now.
- **Evangelize** - Spent every free moment evangelizing across teams about what the API lifecycle is, using the same words and phrasing to describe different stops along the API lifecycle, then producing visual aids that help teams to share API lifecycle knowledge.
- **Educate** - Invest in educational resources, workshops, and other approaches to helping keep teams understanding what the enterprise lifecycle looks like and how it reflects that practices of other leading API providers, providing ongoing education across all teams.
- **Awareness** - Foster awareness at each stop along the API lifecycle, demonstrating the value of possessing a common understanding and approach to defining, designing, and delivering APIs, showing how teams will benefit from mapping our the API lifecycle.
- **Observability** - Build in observability into the API lifecycle as soon as possible, routing data from testing, security, and governance efforts into existing APM solutions, then working to add more outputs across the lifecycle, measuring as much as possible.

Without a known lifecycle you will never be able to stabilize your API operations enough to realize the productivity, quality, and governance you need. You canâ€™t shift-left if there is not a common understanding of which direction is left, and what each stop along the API lifecycle is. Making the API lifecycle one of the first places you need to invest as you look to increase velocity in your API-first transformation.
