# Challenges - Usability
The overall usability of the APIs behind enterprise applications and integrations contribute to the efficiency and velocity of an organization. As the result of adhoc API operations, we see many common challenges when it comes to the usability of APIs across an organizations, which if addressed would significantly shift the speed at which an organization can move.

- **Onboarding Friction (U1)** - APIs require approval before they can be used, or impose other known or unknown challenges when it comes from going to discovery of an API, to making the first request to a sandbox or live API resource.
- **No Documentation (U2)** - The lack of up to date and complete documentation for APIs is the number one npain point faced by API consumers, increasing the time it takes to put digital resources and capabilities to good use.
- **Inconsistent (U3)** - Even the small differences between how APIs work can introduce significant time and money downstream when it comes to putting APIs to work, slowing consumers of digital resources.
- **Not Repeatable (U4)** - Behavior made available via APIs arenâ€™t always repeatable, with unexpected functionality emerging as API consumers work across different APIs, making the development of applications more difficult.
- **Complexity (U5)** - The complexity of how each API works plays a significant role in the usability of enterprise digital resources and capabilities, exponentially slowing down operations when not addressed at scale.
- **Duplication (U6)** - Duplication and overlapping capabilities across teams, domains, and an organizaiton can further blur the usability of digital resources and capabilities, leaving consumers unsure how to put APIs to work.
