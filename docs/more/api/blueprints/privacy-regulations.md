# Privacy Regulations
When your business runs on APIs, and your APIs are defined as contracts, you know where all of your PII, PCI, and PHI is located. Modern privacy regulation focuses on giving consumers access and control over their personal information, and APIs are how this privacy is defined and fulfilled.

- GDPR
- CCPA

The precedent has been set for end users rights to access their data via any platform, with APIs how users will access their data and allow 3rd party developers to access as well. APIs are essential to privacy on the Internet, and will continue to play a role in privacy regulation around the globe.
