# Protocol Buffers
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.

- **Solutions** - Protocol buffers provide a serialization format for packets of typed, structured data that are up to a few megabytes in size, suitable for both ephemeral network traffic and long-term data storage, and extending with new information.
- **Services** - A definition for an individual system that supplies a digital resource or capability, providing a granular unit of business value that can be used internally within the enterprise, but also sometimes made available to partners in secure, but highly performant manner.
- **Messages** - A digital communication for sending serialized and structured, record-like, typed data in a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible manner, providing a highly efficient way of communicating between systems within the enterprise, and with partners.
- **Message Types** - Protocol Buffers allows you to define any type of message you will need to make your digital resources, and capabilities available, giving you full control over how data will be structured, interpreted, and consumed by internal and partner developers.
- **Language Compatibility** - Messages can be read by code written in any programming language, providing a high performant way to make data available across many different platforms, with a robust add-on ecosystem, allowing for a long tail of integrations.

Protocol Buffers provides a solid contract for defining the relationship between your internal services, allowing for large volumes of high quality, and well defined data to be exchanged across the enterprise, and in some cases externally with partners, providing high volume business to business services.
