# Digital Capabilities
A capability is a simple representation of something that can be accomplished digitally, defining a valuable process, workflow, model, or algorithm that is valuable to internal or external consumers. Often defined by one or many API requests or subscriptions that reflect a specific business capability, representing a single product offering, or bundling multiple capabilities together for a specific digital product experience.

## Common Digital Capabilities
APIs are rapidly evolving beyond traditional digital resources and data sources to transform business operations, providing the digital gears of a modern business factory floor and digital supply chain.

- **Workflows** - A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information using API defined resources and workflows.
- **Actions** - Digital capabilities are designed for enabling action of some sort, allowing online or offline things to be triggered, setting additional workflows in motion, but also generating data along the way, producing intended outcomes across platforms or real world devices.
- **Events** - Enterprise organizations are increasingly define by meaningful events occurring across internal and external operations, delivering the intended outcomes business and technical leadership is looking for, allowing for the orchestration of the desired outcomes.
- **Algorithms** - Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models are developed, iterated upon, and applied in increasingly modular ways using APIs, leveraging the data we have stored in databases and the exhaust from daily operations to iterate upon useful algorithms.

Enterprise digital capabilities are defined by APIs, and business is set in motion through automation and orchestration across native, but also 3rd party digital capabilities each organization has access to.
