# Low-Code/No-Code
Low Code/ No Code refers to an ever-growing opportunity to deliver applications without writing code or at least minimizing the amount of code needing to be written. Making producing and consuming APIs much more inclusive to those who are not fluent in writing code, but also makes those who are even more productive in their work. Providing business and technical stakeholders with a variety of solutions for engaging with API operations, and the business that it supports.

- **Inventory** - Provide business and technical stakeholders with a robust inventory of internal, partner, and 3rd party resources to use when creating low-code/no-code integrations and applications, enabling them to do whatever they need across services.
- **Workflows** - Offering the ability to create and evolve common business workflows using many different APIs, allowing APIs to be used by technical and business stakeholders to perform common business jobs they need done without getting hands dirty in the code.
- **Authentication** - The complexities of authentication and authorization should be abstracted away, making it easy for anyone to be able to navigate the secrets needed to authenticate with one or many APIs, and solve authentication problems along the way.
- **Visual** - Making it a visual experience to navigate API inventory, build workflows, configure authentication, so that anyone can stitch together many different APIs together, allowing busines or technical stakeholders tto take advantage of using APIs.
- **Runtime** - Providing a simple runtime that any user can employ to run their workflows, providing the compute needd to make each individual requests, handle responses, and execute workflows in the order intended by the user, powering the jobs they need done.
- **Automation** - Offering the ability to schedule and trigger when specific events occur, setting in motion the desired workflow, allowing anyone to automate common business tasks throughout the day, allowing teams to do more with less, taking advantage of APis.
- **Collaboration** - Allowing teams to collaborate and share workflows, provide feedback, and iterate upon the functionality provided by each workflow, making business integrations, and orchestration a team affair, and something everyone learns from.
- **Observability** - Providing users with the ability to see how they workflows and automations are running, the results of their work, and how it fits into the overall context of what each user is looking to accomplish, helping cultivate more awareness. 

Low-Code/No-Code is how enterprise organizations will deal with the demands of their own digital future where there is perpetually a shortage of developers, expanding more of pipes behind the applications and integrations we depend on to business stakeholders. Providing business stakeholders with the resources and capabilities they need to be successful in their regular operations.
