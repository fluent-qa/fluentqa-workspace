# Applications
APIs are used to deliver resources and digital capabilities across multiple types of applications, providing what is needed to power many different web, mobile, and device applications, as well as system-to-system integration and automation. How the enterprise sees applications and integrations evolves once they begin shifting towards an API-first way of looking at operations, demonstrating how APIs are behind every digital application we depend on today.

## Types
APIs have powered applications since the beginning of compute, but the current breed of web APIs found its roots in aggregating content for web applications, but then quickly expanded to mobile, devices, back to the desktop, and even the network beneath our applications. 

- **Desktop** - APIs are how our desktop applications on our Windows and Mac desktops send and receive data back and forth to the server, making hundreds or thousands of calls each day to created, read, update, and delete the information needed as part of regular usage.
- **Web** - Websites began as simple HTML documents, but have become a dynamic mix of many internal and external API calls being made to stitch together the desired online experience within a specific domain, providing a more rich web than possible before. 
- **Mobile** - Mobile phones allow websites and applications to be accessible in our hands, turning what used to just be a device for voice or messaging into a rich application ecosystem that is sending and receiving data from across many different cloud platforms.
- **Device** - Once developers realized that APIs could power mobile applications they began seeing what other types of mobile devices could be made Internet enabled, moving our televisions, thermostats, automobiles, and almost every other device in our life online.
- **Network** - As more of the infrastructure we depend on for the web moved into the clouds, the network that connected servers and clients together also has become API-enabled, making the network composable and configurable, changing how we operate applications.

These constructs shape what many think of as an “application”, but APIs and the automation and orchestration they power is rapidly changing the notion of how we “apply” our digital resources and capabilities online and offline.
