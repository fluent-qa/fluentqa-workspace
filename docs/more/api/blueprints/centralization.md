# Centralization
The centralization of practices and information within an enterprise organization helps streamline and standardize what is happening across domains and teams, providing the consistent nutrients that teams will need to be successful, while also helping keep disparate teams producing consistent and valuable services.

- **Excellence** - Setting up a center of excellence, bringing together all the necessary knowledge, skills, and practices, then working to evanglize them across domains and teams, helping bring more awareness, participation, and feedback from different teams.
- **Expertise** - Centralizing business an technical leadership, architects, and other expertise into a single group that meets regularly to help identify and evolve knowledge and practices that teams need to be successful in an ongoing and centralized manner.
- **Leadership** - Establishing clear and engaging leadership for centeralized governance, taking a lead role in demonstrating how and why API governance matters without ever having to say the word governance, or being seen as an enforcing centralized entity.
- **Domains** - Thoughtfully carve the enterprise in logical domains, reflecting, but also transcending the tribal boundaries that have emerged from lines of business, business vs IT, and legacy acquisitions to establish clear articulations of business domains.
- **Vocabulary** - Define the common vocabulary that is used within domains, providing the language that teams will use when designing APIs, but also engaging with consumers of those APIs, helping make producing and consuming APIs as intuitive as it possibly can.
- **Rules** - Crafting, evolving, educating, and helping incentivize the applications of linting rules across domain contracts and artifacts, and evn applied as part of policies used across gateways and other stops along the lifecycle to help stabilize API operations.
- **Enablement** - Provide the best possible services, tooling, standards, and other resources for teams, helping enablem them to do the right thing, making it easy for them to deliver and operate consistent APIs, no matter team which created and owns them.
- **Feedback Loop** - Foster an active two-way feedback loop with teams, encouraging feedback on governance, allowing teams to help dictate and own the evolution of how centralized guidance is evolved and applied on the ground, across federated API teams.

How much of governance becomes centralized will vary depending on an organization, the culture that exists teams, and the industries they operate in, which is why having a conversation regarding about what should and shouldnâ€™t be centralized amongst leadership, but also across teams is very important.
