# Forward Motion
There are only minor differences in efficiency and velocity between taking a design-first, code-first, proxy-first, or prototype-first approach to deliver a new API or iterating upon an existing API. The major gain in efficiency and velocity comes when all APIs possess contracts, up to date documentation, and are fully tested, and able to be governed, bringing all APIs into a common, well-known API lifecycle, no matter how teams decide to actually begin their journey.

- **Lifecycle** - A common, agreed upon API lifecycle is emerging across teams, and the various ways for entering it are well understood and accepted across API development.
- **Contracts** - There are up to date and accurate machine readable contracts available for all APIs, no matter how the API lifecycle is entered, ensuring business value can be validated.
- **Discoverable** - Every API is discoverable, including the metadata for an API, the contracts defining what is possible, as well as the operations surrounding the API in production.
- **Productivity** - Teams can move forward at the desired velocity for the team, but also the company, while not compromising quality, keeping teams as productive as possible.
- **Quality** - There is contract and performance test coverage across as close to 100% of the surface area of APIs as possible, ensuring a baseline of quality moving forward.
- **Observable** - Every API is observable, as well as the API lifecycle around them, providing awareness and control over all aspects of the API lifecycle, and how APIs are being used.
- **Governance** - APIs are discoverable, reliable, consistent, and delivered in a standardized way, no matter which team is developing them–governing the forward motion the enterprise.

The goal of the API lifecycle isn’t to restrict teams to one way of delivering APIs, but to help establish a common vocabulary for how we talk about the API lifecycle, helping us get on the same page regarding what is important across the API lifecycle, and contributing to the forward motion of our API operations.
