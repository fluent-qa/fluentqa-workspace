# Composable
Modern software is composable, assembling, evolving, and decommissioning business resources and capabilities that meet the ever-changing needs of the enterprise. Perpetually building with, but also inventing modular industrial-grade Lego building blocks that power the web, mobile, and device applications we need to do business at the pace of the Internet.

- **Resources** - Every digital resource produced and consumed by the enterprise is available for use. Mapping out all of the atoms of your digital transformation, keeping business with what it needs to operate, and compete globally in a digital landscape.
- **Capabilities** - Essential workflows and algorithms are well-defined using many private, partner, and public APIs, documenting what the enterprise is capable of in any moment, while also being ready to adapt, change, and respond to entire new needs of the market.
- **Modular** - Enterprise resources and capabilities are as modular as possible, driving re-use and collectively applying at scale. Reducing business value down to the smallest most reliable form, then productizing and making available to consumers via APIs.
- **Distributed** - The enterprise is distributed geographically and organizationally, giving domains, groups,  and teams the agency they need to deliver essential enterprise resources and capabilities while minimizing their dependency on other enterprise teams.
- **Discoverable** - All of the building blocks of the enterprise are discoverable, making digital resources and capabilities available to both business and technical stakeholders and consumers, ensuring they have what they need to conduct business and compete.
- **Self-Service** - Enterprise digital resources and capabilities are available in a self-service way with visibility available only to intended audiences. Allowing those who should have access the ability to sign-up and begin putting APIs to work with as few steps possible.
- **Reliable** - Everwhat teams need when y digital resource and capability is reliable, providing what they need without friction. Establishing and maintaining trust with consumers, do exactly what they need in a way they can depend on without concern.
- **Observable** - The ability to observe the usage of any digital resource or capability is the default, no matter how many times something is reused and bundled with other services, making awareness regarding how resources and capabilities are applied at scale.

Modern software is composable because APIs exist just beneath the surface. APIs are how massive enterprise operations are made composable, reusable, and scalable, through doing the hard work of reshaping the enterprise into the most valuable and reusable business value.
