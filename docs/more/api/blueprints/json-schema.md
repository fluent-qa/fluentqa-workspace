# JSON Schema
The JSON Schema specification provides a machine and human-readable way for describing digital objects that are used as part of API requests and responses, as well as the messages we publish and subscribe to our more asynchronous APIs. Providing us with a way to describe the structure of our digital resources and capabilities in a way that we can validate during design, development, or while in production.

- **Objects** - Objects are a way to define digital structures, providing a machine readable way to describe meaningful concepts that are exchanged online using different types of APIs, passing data around in a way that makes it easy to have a shared understanding.
- **Properties** - The individual characteristics of an object, providing the details that give an object meaning and value, describing the name and email for a person object, or name and description for a product object, providing a logical set of properties that applications can understand.
- **Property Names** - Each property has a name, allowing each individual characteristic of an object to be described in a way that makes sense to consumers, providing a shared meaning of a specific aspect of a digital object being made available via an API.
- **Property Description** - Each property can also have a description, providing much more detail about what the object property will contain, helping convey as much meaning and purpose behind why the property exists, and how API consumers can use in applications.
- **Property Type** - Allowing each property to be defined as a string, number, object, and other common or custom types, formeally articulating what can be expected a property to contain, helping be very strict or even loose when it comes to data available in objects.
- **Property Patterns** - Patterns allow for regular expressions to be used to articulate in a very precise way what a property should contain, providing a universal way of precesiy describing the contents, ordering, and structure of the data that is available via each object property.
- **Required** - Defining a list of the properties for each object is required to be present whenever you are moving objects around synchronously or asynchronous via APIs, help define the minimum amount of information needed to define an object made available.

JSON Schema is how the digital bits we are passing around the web each day gets validated behind the scenes, making sure the requests we make and the response receive are as correct and usable as possible.
