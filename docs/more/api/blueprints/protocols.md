# Protocols
There are a variety of Internet protocols that are in use across the World Wide Web, regional, and local area networks, providing well-known protocols for transporting digital resources and capabilities around the globe in service of digital commerce. The most well-known protocol is the hypertext transfer protocol, or HTTP, which is the backbone of the web we know today, but HTTP is getting a makeover, as well as regular use of other leading protocols across the API landscape.

## API Protocols

- **HTTP 1.1** - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP is an protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems, providing a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks involved in distributed object management systems.
- **HTTP/2** - HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google, then adopted by the HTTP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.
- **HTTP/3** - HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, alongside HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP/3 always runs over QUIC, which provides a next generation approach to the Internet.
- **TCP** - The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
- **MQTT** - MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP/IP, however, any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT.

Whic protocol used when delivering an API will set the tone with consumers regarding what is possible, and will provide constraints regarding which patterns can be employed, and what is possible across the API lifecycle, shaping your journey, and the outcomes of your API operations.
